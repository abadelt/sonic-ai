# Sonic AI
## Music as Code, but AI-powered

Code for conference session presented at KI Navigator 2023 in Nuremberg

Sonic AI is dependent on a modified version of langchain4j, which currently exists only as a fork at https://github.com/abadelt/langchain4j and has to be locally built (working on having it pulled into the official langchain4j project).
